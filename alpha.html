		<h2>Why I picked up Web Dev</h2>
		<p>
			At the age of 10, I wanted to learn how to create websites because my dream was to be the founder of the next PornHub. Needless to say, my hopes and aspirations were dashed when I turned out to be gay!
			<br><br>
			But as luck would have it, I met with the most handsomest of men one day. Words cannot begin to describe his extreme intellect. The moment I saw him, I was stunned; entrapped in his gaze. Lu Xuanchun: the Man, the Myth, the Legend. Needless to say, I become absolutely smitten with this esteemed individual, with whom I would have many <i>exciting escapadesâ„¢</i>. His supple hands and nimble fingers betray his demeaning figure; for under the dark crimson eyes lies a man of great heart. They say, do not judge a book by its cover - indeed, this was a man who was great inside.

			<br><br>
			Soon, we would do everything together - eating, playing, even teaching the Algorithms course. But alas, that course was only a shallow excuse for us to continue to be together, but <sub>shhh don't tell anyone</sub> I mean the course would be a great opportunity to <s>fondle</s> I mean improve each other.
			<br><br>
			Sorry, was this a story about why I love Web Development? Nay, this is a story about how I love Lu Xuanchun.

			No amount of words is sufficient to express this fellow's handsome looks.
			<br><br>
			Hark! At his gaze; his eyes search for nothing but the most exemplary of Japanese arts. He is a Master at his craft, the disciple of the Gods, and for us lowly peasants - he is the ruler of all creation. We can never begin to comprehend how, and <i>why</i> such a divine being could ever come to be.
